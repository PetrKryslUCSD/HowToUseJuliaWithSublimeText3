One of the biggest user-facing changes is the completion system has been expanded to allow users and plugin authors to provide better, more rich completions.

We allow for multiple views to be selected at once, which provides some unique ways to navigate code and jump back to where you were. You can see an example of using it by clicking the square icon the right of a symbol definition link in the definitions popup when you hover your mouse over a function or class name.

We've improved find in files in a number of ways, and added better integration with .gitignore files
There is now Python 3.8 for plugins, and we have OpenGL rendering for better performance on high-dpi screens.

Symbols in the Goto Symbol and Goto Symbol in Project lists know what "kind" of a symbol it is, so you can jump to a function or class that have the same name

We now have HTML sheets, with should allow plugin authors to present rich formatted text to users. It isn't a full browser, so you wouldn't preview web pages in them, but you could use it for presenting documentation or something like basic Markdown previews.
